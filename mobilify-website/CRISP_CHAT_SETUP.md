```

üöÄ Starter App: $5,000+ (website conversion)
üí° Custom App: $15,000+ (new app development)
üè¢ Enterprise: Custom pricing (complex projects)

Would you like to tell me more about your project so I can give you a more specific estimate?
```

```
Timeline varies by project complexity:

üì± Simple app: 4-6 weeks
üé® Custom design: 6-10 weeks  
üîß Complex features: 10-16 weeks

What type of app are you thinking about? I can give you a more accurate timeline.

### Mobile Optimization

- iPhone (Safari)

   - Check that `NEXT_PUBLIC_CRISP_WEBSITE_ID` is set correctly

   - Clear browser cache and reload

2. **Analytics not tracking**
