# Services Page Issues - Fixed

## üéØ Issues Identified and Resolved

### Issue 1: Compare All Features & Pricing Table Visibility ‚úÖ FIXED
**Problem**: Table doesn't show until you scroll down away from it
**Root Cause**: Framer Motion `whileInView` animation with default viewport settings
**Solution**: Added `margin: "-100px"` to viewport configuration to trigger animation earlier

**Changes Made:**
```tsx
// Before
viewport={{ once: true }}

// After  
viewport={{ once: true, margin: "-100px" }}
```

### Issue 2: "Invalid website" Label ‚úÖ FIXED
**Problem**: Label with text "Invalid website" appears in bottom right corner
**Root Cause**: Crisp Chat trying to initialize with placeholder value `your_crisp_website_id_here`
**Solution**: Added validation to prevent Crisp Chat from loading with invalid/placeholder IDs

**Changes Made:**
- Added `isValidCrispId()` function to validate Crisp website IDs
- Enhanced CrispChat component to check for placeholder values
- Prevents initialization when ID contains 'your_crisp_website_id' or is too short
- Added proper warning messages for invalid configurations

### Issue 3: Navigation Not Working ‚úÖ FIXED
**Problem**: Header navigation (Home, How It Works, About Us, Chat) doesn't work from Services page
**Root Cause**: Navigation component trying to scroll to sections that don't exist on Services page
**Solution**: Enhanced navigation logic to handle cross-page navigation

**Changes Made:**
- Updated `Navigation.tsx` to detect current page context
- Added "Home" link when not on home page
- Enhanced `handleNavigation()` function to:
  - Handle direct page navigation (like Home)
  - Scroll to sections if they exist on current page
  - Navigate to home page with hash if sections don't exist
- Improved navigation UX across all pages
