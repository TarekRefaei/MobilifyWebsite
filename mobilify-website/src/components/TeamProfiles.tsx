              Why We Started Mobilify
            </h3>
            <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
              After years of working at leading tech companies, we saw firsthand how mobile apps 
              could transform businesses. Yet, we also witnessed countless entrepreneurs and small 
              businesses struggle with the complexity and cost of mobile development. Mobilify was 
              born from our desire to bridge this gap â€“ to make world-class mobile app development 
              accessible to everyone with a great idea.
