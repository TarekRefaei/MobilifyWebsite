## Phase 1: Asset & Configuration Externalization

> **Goal:** Remove all hardcoded values from the codebase. Everything should be configurable from a single source of truth (environment variables, a constants file, or the CMS).

### 1.1. Centralized Constants (`src/config/site.ts`) ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- [x] Create a `src/config/site.ts` file for static, developer-controlled configuration.
- [x] Move static, non-sensitive data that doesn't belong in the CMS into this file:
  - [x] Site name (`Mobilify`)
  - [x] Company contact email (`contact@mobilify.dev`)
  - [x] Social media links and URLs
  - [x] Main navigation links structure
  - [x] Default fallback values for CMS content
  - [x] API endpoints and external service URLs
  - [x] SEO configuration and metadata
  - [x] Animation constants and easing functions
  - [x] Service offerings configuration
- [x] Update all components to import these values from `src/config/site.ts` instead of using hardcoded strings.

### 1.2. Text & Content Audit (Sanity CMS) ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- [x] Review all high-level components (`Hero.tsx`, `AboutSnippet.tsx`, `ServicesOverview.tsx`, `Process.tsx`, `Contact.tsx`, `Header.tsx`, `Footer.tsx`).
- [x] Identify all dynamic UI text (headlines, paragraphs, button labels, form success/error messages) that should be content-managed.
- [x] **Create `siteSettings` Singleton Schema:** Extended existing Sanity configuration:
  - [x] Added `SiteSettings` interface to `src/lib/sanity.ts`
  - [x] Created comprehensive field structure for all content sections
  - [x] Added `SITE_SETTINGS_QUERY` for fetching singleton data
  - [x] Implemented proper TypeScript types for all fields
  ```typescript
  // Added to src/lib/sanity.ts
  export interface SiteSettings {
    _id: string;
    _type: 'siteSettings';
    // Hero Section
    heroHeadline?: string;
    heroSubtext?: string;
    heroButtonText?: string;
    // Contact Section
    contactHeadline?: string;
    contactSubtext?: string;
    contactButtonText?: string;
    // Form Messages
    formSuccessMessage?: string;
    formErrorMessage?: string;
    // Services, Process, About sections...
  }
  ```
- [ ] **Content Migration:** Manual population pending (requires Sanity Studio schema deployment):
  1. Deploy updated schema to Sanity Studio
  2. Open "Site Settings" document in Studio
  3. Copy/paste current hardcoded text from website into corresponding fields
  4. Publish changes to make CMS the source of truth
- [x] Create utility function `getSiteSettings()` in `src/lib/sanity.ts` to fetch singleton data.
- [x] Update components to fetch content from Sanity, with fallbacks to static strings from `site.ts`.

### 1.3. Color & Theme Audit ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- [x] Perform a global search for hardcoded hex color values (e.g., `#4f46e5`, `#111827`).
- [x] Search for non-semantic Tailwind CSS color classes (e.g., `bg-indigo-600`, `text-gray-900`).
- [x] Identified existing semantic color tokens in `tailwind.config.js` (`electric-blue`, `dark-charcoal`).
- [x] Enhanced `tailwind.config.js` with comprehensive semantic color tokens (surface, text, border, status colors).
- [x] Replace remaining instances with semantic color tokens from `tailwind.config.js`.
- [x] Verify that all components render correctly in both light and dark modes after the changes.

### 1.4. Image & Media Asset Management ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- [x] Create a dedicated `public/images/` directory for static UI images (e.g., logos, favicons, static placeholders).
- [x] Created organized subdirectories: `logos/`, `icons/`, `placeholders/`
- [x] Added comprehensive README.md with usage guidelines and naming conventions
- [x] **For Content Images (Team Photos, etc.):**
  - [x] Documented that content images should be uploaded to Sanity CMS, not stored locally
  - [x] Established clear separation between static UI assets and dynamic content images
- [x] No images currently stored inside the `src` directory (verified clean structure)

### 1.5. Environment Variable Audit ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- [x] Scan the entire codebase for any hardcoded API keys, URLs, or other secrets.
- [x] Ensure every external service configuration is powered by an environment variable.
- [x] Verify that `.env.local.example` is complete and documents every required variable with a placeholder.
- [x] Implemented `EXTERNAL_SERVICES` configuration in `site.ts` for centralized env var access.

  - [x] `FooterNav.tsx` - Organized navigation links with analytics tracking
  - [x] `FooterNewsletter.tsx` - Newsletter signup with validation and submission tracking
- [ ] **`/services` page:** The comparison table should be its own component:
  - [ ] `PricingTable.tsx`

### 2.3. Hooks & Logic Abstraction ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- [x] Create a `src/hooks/` directory.
- [x] **`useContactForm.ts`:** Extract the form state management, validation, and submission logic from the `ContactForm` component into a custom hook.

  - [x] Existing InteractiveDemo events
  - [x] All future analytics needs across the site
- [x] **`useSiteSettings.ts`:** Created hook for CMS content fetching with fallback system
- [x] **`hooks/index.ts`:** Clean export structure for all hooks

### 2.4. Type Definitions ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- [x] Create a `src/types/` directory.
- [x] **`sanity.ts`:** Define all interfaces for data fetched from Sanity (e.g., `SiteSettings`, `BlogPost`, `FAQItem`, `TeamMember`, `Service`, `Testimonial`, `CaseStudy`).
- [x] **`forms.ts`:** Define comprehensive types for form inputs, states, validation, and configuration.
- [x] **`analytics.ts`:** Define analytics event types for better type safety and tracking.
- [x] **`index.ts`:** Re-export all types with utility types and common interfaces.
- [x] Remove all shared `type` and `interface` definitions from component files and import them from the central types directory.

### 3.1. Code Commenting & Naming ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- [x] Add JSDoc comments to every component, explaining its purpose and props.
- [x] Add inline comments for any complex algorithms or non-obvious business logic.
- [x] Audit all file, variable, and function names to ensure they are descriptive and consistent.

### 3.2. Finalizing Documentation ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- [x] **Create `CONTRIBUTING.md`:**
  - [x] Document the new project structure and explain the purpose of each directory.
  - [x] Provide clear instructions on how to add a new page, section, or UI component.

  - [x] Add a "Project Structure" section that links to the more detailed `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
- [x] **Create `API.md`:**
  - [x] Comprehensive API documentation for hooks, components, and utilities.
  - [x] Usage examples and best practices for developers.

### 3.3. Testing Integration (Comprehensive Coverage)
- [ ] **Unit Tests:** As components are broken down (InteractiveDemo ‚Üí DemoTabs, Header ‚Üí MobileMenu), create individual unit tests for new smaller components.
- [ ] **Integration Tests:** Update parent component tests to:
  - Mock new data-fetching logic (Sanity CMS and hooks)
  - Test "success" path (CMS data present)
  - Test "fallback" path (CMS data missing, using `site.ts` defaults)
- [ ] **Test Updates:** As each component is refactored, immediately update its corresponding test file in `src/__tests__/` and `src/components/__tests__/`.
- [ ] **Regression Prevention:** Ensure all existing tests pass after each refactoring step. A component refactoring is only "done" when tests are updated and passing.
- [ ] **New Test Coverage:** Add comprehensive tests for:
  - New hooks (`useContactForm.ts`, `useAnalytics.ts`)
  - Extracted components (DemoTabs, MobileMenu, etc.)

## Implementation Notes

### Development Workflow (Branch-Based Approach)
Create separate branches for each phase to maintain stability and enable focused reviews:
- `refactor/phase-1-externalization` - Asset & configuration externalization
- `refactor/phase-2-structure` - File structure reorganization
- `refactor/phase-3-quality` - Documentation and quality improvements

### Sanity CMS Integration
- **Existing Setup:** The project already has Sanity CMS configured with blog and FAQ schemas. The task is to add the new `siteSettings` singleton schema to the existing Sanity Studio.
- **Environment Variables:** All necessary Sanity environment variables are already defined in `.env.local.example`.
- **Content Migration:** Manual population of CMS content from existing hardcoded values (no migration script needed).

### Fallback Strategy
- **Primary:** Sanity CMS content (dynamic, content-managed)
- **Fallback:** Static strings in `src/config/site.ts` (prevents broken UI)
- **Implementation:** Components fetch from Sanity with graceful degradation to `site.ts` defaults

### Migration Priority
1. **Phase 1.1 & 1.2:** Complete externalization of constants and content before any structural changes
2. **Phase 2:** Reorganize file structure with already-cleaned components
3. **Phase 3:** Documentation and quality improvements with comprehensive test coverage

### Testing Strategy
- **Comprehensive Coverage:** Both unit and integration tests required
- **Refactoring Safety:** Existing tests are the safety net - external behavior must remain unchanged
- **Immediate Updates:** Update tests immediately after refactoring each component
- **CMS Integration:** Verify functionality works with both CMS content and fallback values
