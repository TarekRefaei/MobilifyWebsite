    - Code splitting for route-based chunks
    - Minimize third-party script impact on main bundle
- [x] **Caching Strategy (Leverage Next.js App Router):**
  - [x] **Static Generation and ISR:**
    - Use Static Site Generation (SSG) for blog posts with ISR for updates
    - Cache Sanity CMS responses with appropriate revalidation periods
    - Implement proper cache headers for static assets
    - Use Next.js built-in data cache for API responses
  - [x] **Client-Side Optimization:**
